## 📝 NOTES FROM AGENT A

```
Agent B - 

Your backend is ready and waiting for you! I've built:
- Complete API for consultations, orders, earnings
- Security hardened and HIPAA compliant
- All endpoints documented in docs/API_REFERENCE.md

You need to:
1. Fix the duplicate code issues (see AGENT_B_QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md)
2. Complete the UI components
3. Integrate with my APIs

The backend won't change - it's production ready. Focus on the frontend!

- Agent A
```
