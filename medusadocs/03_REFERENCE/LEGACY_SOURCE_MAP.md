# Legacy Source Map

This index previously linked to `trimmed_part*.md` files created during one-time splitting of the original `llms-full.txt` corpus. Those files are intentionally not part of the current curated docs set.

Use this mapping instead:

- Data model patterns: `../02_BUILDING/MODULES.md`
- Workflow patterns: `../02_BUILDING/WORKFLOWS.md`
- API and middleware patterns: `../02_BUILDING/API_ROUTES.md`
- Admin UI patterns: `../02_BUILDING/ADMIN_UI.md`
- Auth and security patterns: `../02_BUILDING/AUTH_SECURITY.md`
- Troubleshooting and edge cases: `./TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Built-in workflow catalog: `./CORE_WORKFLOWS.md`
- Event catalog: `./EVENTS_REFERENCE.md`

If you still cannot find a needed pattern, run targeted searches in `../../llms-full.txt` (for example with `rg`) and backfill useful findings into `medusadocs/`.
